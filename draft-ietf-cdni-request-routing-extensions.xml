      <t>The Open Caching working group of the Streaming Video Alliance is focused 
         on the delegation of video delivery requests from commercial CDNs to a 
         caching layer at the ISP. In that aspect, Open Caching is a specific use
         case of CDNI, where the commercial CDN is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the
         ISP caching layer is the downstream CDN (dCDN). The extensions specified in this
         document to the CDNI Metadata and FCI interfaces are derived from requirements raised by 
         Open Caching but are applicable to CDNI use cases in general.</t>

    <section anchor="redirect-target-capability" title="Redirect Target Capability Object">
      <t>Iterative request redirect as defined in section 1.1 of <xref target="RFC7336"/> requries the 
         provisioning of a redirect target address to be used by the uCDN in order to redirect to the dCDN.
         Redirect target addresses can vary between different footprints, for example, between different regions,
         and they may also change over time, for example as a result of network problems. Given this variable 
         and dynamic nature of the redirect target, it may not be suitable to advertise it during bootstrap. 
         A more dynamic and footprint oriented interface is required. Therefore, we have chosen to use 
         the CDNI Footprint and Capabilities interface for redirect target advertisement.</t>
         
      <t>Use cases<list style="symbols">
         <t>Footprint: The dCDN may want to have a different target per footprint. 
            Note that a dCDN may spread across multiple geographies. This makes it 
            easier to route client requests to a nearby request router. Though this can be achieved 
            using a single canonical name and Geo DNS, that approach has limitations; 
            for example a client may be using a third party DNS resolver, making it 
            impossible for the redirector to detect where the client is located, or Geo DNS 
            granularity may be too rough for the requirement of the application.</t>

         <t>Scaling: The dCDN may choose to scale its request routing service by deploying more request routers 
            in new locations and advertise them via an updatable interface like the FCI.</t>

      </list></t>
      <t>The Redirect Target capability object is used to indicate the target address the uCDN should use in order
         to redirect a client to the dCDN. A target may be attached to a specific uCDN host, a list of uCDN hosts, 
         or used globally for all the hosts of the uCDN. 
      </t>
      <t>
         When a dCDN is attaching the redirect target to a specific uCDN host or a list of uCDN hosts, the dCDN MUST 
         advertise the hosts within the Redirect Target capability object as "redirecting-hosts". In that case, the 
         uCDN can redirect to that dCDN address, only if the request was directed to one of those uCDN hosts.
      </t>
      <t>
         A redirect target for DNS redirection is an IP address used as an A record response or a FQDN used as an alias 
         in a CNAME record response (see <xref target="RFC1034"/>) of the uCDN DNS router. Note that DNS routers make 
         routing decisions based on either the DNS resolver's IP address or the client IP address when EDNS0 client-subnet 
         is used (see <xref target="RFC7871"/>). The dCDN may choose to advertise redirect targets and footprints to 
         cover both cases. A uCDN DNS router implemenation SHOULD prefer routing based on client IP address when it is available.
      </t>
      <t>
         A redirect target for HTTP redirection is the URI to be used as the value for the Location header of a HTTP redirect 
         3xx response, typically a 302 (Found) (see section 7.1.2 of <xref target="RFC7231"/> and section 6.4 of 
         <xref target="RFC7231"/>). 
      </t>
      <section anchor="redirect-target-capability-properties" title="Properties of Redirect Target Capability Object">
         <t>The Redirect Target capability object consists of the following properties:</t>

    <section anchor="fallback-target-metadata" title="Fallback Target Address Metadata">
      <t>Open Caching requires that the uCDN provide a fallback target server to the 
         dCDN, to be used in cases where the dCDN cannot properly handle the request. 
         To avoid redirect loops, the fallback target server's address at the uCDN MUST be 
         differnet from the original uCDN address from which the client was redirected 
         to the dCDN. The uCDN MUST avoid further redirection when receiving the client request at 
         the fallback target. The fallback target is defined as a generic metadata object 
         (see section 3.2 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>)</t>
         
      <t>Use cases<list style="symbols">
         <t>Failover: A dCDN request router receives a request but has no caches 
            to which it can route the request. This can happen in the case of 
            failures or temporary network overload.</t>
         
         <t>No coverage: A dCDN request router receives a request from a client located
            in an area inside the footprint but not covered by the dCDN caches or outside the dCDN 
            footprint coverage. In such cases, the router may choose to redirect the request back 
            to the uCDN fallback address.</t>

         <t>Error: A cache may receive a request that it cannot properly serve, for 
            example, some of the metadata objects for that service were not properly 
            acquired. In this case, the cache may resolve to redirect back to uCDN.</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>The Fallback target metadata object is used to indicate the target address the dCDN should use in order
         to redirect a client back to the uCDN. Fallback target is represented as endpoint objects as defined in 
         section 4.3.3 of <xref target="RFC8006"/>.</t>
         
      <t>The uCDN fallback target address may be used as a DNS A record or CNAME record in case of DNS redirection 
         or a hostname for HTTP redirect.</t>

      <t>When using HTTP redirect to route a client request back to the uCDN, it is the dCDN's responsibility
         to use the original URL path as the client would have used for the original uCDN request, stripping, 
         if needed, the dCDN path-prefix and/or the uCDN hostname from the redirect URL that may have been used to 
         request the content from the dCDN.</t>
